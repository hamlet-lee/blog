# Java DataOutputStream 使用的是 "big endian"

You can not do this with DataOutputStream, which always uses big endian.

You can use a ByteBuffer on which you can call order() to influence how it reads and writes data.

You can use the ByteBuffer either to prepare a byte[] that you'll write with a classical OutputStream later on or go entirely to NIO and use any WritableByteChannel for the writing
