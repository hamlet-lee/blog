1. Windows 安装
    * 在[这里](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)下载rustup-init.exe，并运行。  
      提示信息
      ```shell
      Rust Visual C++ prerequisites

      Rust requires the Microsoft C++ build tools for Visual Studio 2013 or later,
      but they don't seem to be installed.

      The easiest way to acquire the build tools is by installing Microsoft Visual
      C++ Build Tools 2019 which provides just the Visual C++ build tools:

        https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2019

      Please ensure the Windows 10 SDK component is included when installing the
      Visual C++ Build Tools.

      Alternately, you can install Visual Studio 2019, Visual Studio 2017, Visual
      Studio 2015, or Visual Studio 2013 and during install select the "C++ tools":

        https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/

      Install the C++ build tools before proceeding.

      If you will be targeting the GNU ABI or otherwise know what you are doing then
      it is fine to continue installation without the build tools, but otherwise,
      install the C++ build tools before proceeding.
      ```
    cargo相关程序在 ```C:\Users\Administrator\.cargo\bin```  
        可能需要手工加到系统环境变量PATH里。
        ```shell
        Rust is installed now. Great!

        To get started you need Cargo's bin directory (%USERPROFILE%\.cargo\bin) in
        your PATH environment variable. Future applications will automatically have the
        correct environment, but you may need to restart your current shell.
        ```

    * 另外需要安装MSVC的构建工具，https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2019
    * IDE 可以用 https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/
 
1. [Hello World](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch01-02-hello-world.html)
    * 代码 main.rs
        ```rust
        fn main() {
            println!("Hello, world!");
        }
        ```

    * "!" 表示调用宏
        ```rust
        println!("Hello, world!");
        ```
    * rustc 是编译程序
        ```shell
        rustc main.rs
        ```
1. 参考文档：https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/string/struct.String.html
1. Cargo
    ```shell
    # create project
    cargo new xxx

    # compile and generate executable
    cargo build

    # check syntax
    cargo check

    # compile and run
    cargo run

    # build release version
    cargo build --release
    ```

1. [猜数游戏](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html)
    ```rust
    // If a type you want to use isn’t in the prelude, you have to bring that type into scope explicitly with a "use" statement. 
    use std::io;

    fn main() {
        println!("Guess the number!");

        println!("Please input your guess.");
        // "let" statement, which is used to create a variable
        // In Rust, variables are immutable by default. 
        // use "mut" before the variable name to make a variable mutable
        // "String" is a string type provided by the standard library that is a growable, UTF-8 encoded bit of text.
        // The :: syntax in the ::new line indicates that new is an "associated function" (static method) of the String type
        let mut guess = String::new();
        
        // Now we’ll call the stdin function from the io module:
        // If we hadn’t listed the use std::io line at the beginning of the program,
        // we could have written this function call as "std::io::stdin"
        // The "&" indicates that this argument is a reference
        // references are immutable by default. Hence, you need to write "&mut guess"
        // read_line returns a value—in this case, an io::Result. 
        // Rust has some Result types: a generic Result as well as specific versions for submodules, such as io::Result.
        // The "Result" types are enumerations, 
        // For Result, the variants are "Ok" or "Err"
        // If this instance of io::Result is an Err value, expect will cause the program to crash and display the message that you passed as an argument to expect
        // If this instance of io::Result is an Ok value, expect will take the return value that Ok is holding and return just that value to you so you can use it.
        io::stdin().read_line(&mut guess)
            .expect("Failed to read line");

        println!("You guessed: {}", guess);
    }
    ```
    
    Remember that a crate is a collection of Rust source code files. The project we’ve been building is a binary crate, which is an executable. The rand crate is a library crate, which contains code intended to be used in other programs.
