  > The most basic type of state in Flink is ValueState, a data type that adds fault tolerance to any variable it wraps. ValueState is a form of keyed state, meaning it is only available in operators that are applied in a keyed context; any operator immediately following DataStream#keyBy. A keyed state of an operator is automatically scoped to the key of the record that is currently processed.
  
```java
public class FraudDetector extends KeyedProcessFunction<Long, Transaction, Alert> {

    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    private transient ValueState<Boolean> flagState;

    @Override
    public void open(Configuration parameters) {
        ValueStateDescriptor<Boolean> flagDescriptor = new ValueStateDescriptor<>(
                "flag",
                Types.BOOLEAN);
        flagState = getRuntimeContext().getState(flagDescriptor);
    }
```

> Notice that ValueState<Boolean> actually has three states, unset ( null), true, and false, because all ValueState’s are nullable. 
KeyedProcessFunction#processElement is called with a Context that contains a timer service. The timer service can be used to query the current time, register timers, and delete timers. With this, you can set a timer for 1 minute in the future every time the flag is set and store the timestamp in timerState.
```java
    private transient ValueState<Boolean> flagState;
    private transient ValueState<Long> timerState;

    @Override
    public void open(Configuration parameters) {
        ValueStateDescriptor<Boolean> flagDescriptor = new ValueStateDescriptor<>(
                "flag",
                Types.BOOLEAN);
        flagState = getRuntimeContext().getState(flagDescriptor);

        ValueStateDescriptor<Long> timerDescriptor = new ValueStateDescriptor<>(
                "timer-state",
                Types.LONG);
        timerState = getRuntimeContext().getState(timerDescriptor);
    }
```
```java
if (transaction.getAmount() < SMALL_AMOUNT) {
    // set the flag to true
    flagState.update(true);

    // set the timer and timer state
    long timer = context.timerService().currentProcessingTime() + ONE_MINUTE;
    context.timerService().registerProcessingTimeTimer(timer);
    timerState.update(timer);
}
```

> Processing time is wall clock time, and is determined by the system clock of the machine running the operator.
When a timer fires, it calls KeyedProcessFunction#onTimer. Overriding this method is how you can implement your callback to reset the flag.

```java
@Override
public void onTimer(long timestamp, OnTimerContext ctx, Collector<Alert> out) {
    // remove flag after 1 minute
    timerState.clear();
    flagState.clear();
}
```

# Flink Table API
https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.10/getting-started/walkthroughs/table_api.html
> Grouping data based on time is a typical operation in data processing, especially when working with infinite streams. A grouping based on time is called a window and Flink offers flexible windowing semantics. The most basic type of window is called a Tumble window, which has a fixed size and whose buckets do not overlap.

```java
tEnv
    .scan("transactions")
    .window(Tumble.over("1.hour").on("timestamp").as("w"))
    .groupBy("accountId, w")
    .select("accountId, w.start as timestamp, amount.sum")
    .insertInto("spend_report");
```

> This defines your application as using one hour tumbling windows based on the timestamp column. So a row with timestamp 2019-06-01 01:23:47 is put in the 2019-06-01 01:00:00 window.

Aggregations based on time are unique because time, as opposed to other attributes, generally moves forward in a continuous streaming application. In a batch context, windows offer a convenient API for grouping records by a timestamp attribute.
