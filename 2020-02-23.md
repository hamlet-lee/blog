  * 状态保存
  > The most basic type of state in Flink is ValueState, a data type that adds fault tolerance to any variable it wraps. ValueState is a form of keyed state, meaning it is only available in operators that are applied in a keyed context; any operator immediately following DataStream#keyBy. A keyed state of an operator is automatically scoped to the key of the record that is currently processed.
  
```java
public class FraudDetector extends KeyedProcessFunction<Long, Transaction, Alert> {

    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    private transient ValueState<Boolean> flagState;

    @Override
    public void open(Configuration parameters) {
        ValueStateDescriptor<Boolean> flagDescriptor = new ValueStateDescriptor<>(
                "flag",
                Types.BOOLEAN);
        flagState = getRuntimeContext().getState(flagDescriptor);
    }
```

> Notice that ValueState<Boolean> actually has three states, unset ( null), true, and false, because all ValueState’s are nullable.
