# iotop 的使用
```
DESCRIPTION
       iotop  watches  I/O usage information output by the Linux kernel (requires 2.6.20 or later) and displays a table of current I/O usage by
       processes or threads on the system. At least the CONFIG_TASK_DELAY_ACCT and CONFIG_TASK_IO_ACCOUNTING options need to be enabled in your
       Linux kernel build configuration, these options depend on CONFIG_TASKSTATS.

       iotop requires root or the NET_ADMIN capability.

       iotop  displays  columns  for the I/O bandwidth read and written by each process/thread during the sampling period. It also displays the
       percentage of time the thread/process spent while swapping in and while waiting on I/O. For each process, its I/O priority (class/level)
       is shown.  In addition, the total I/O bandwidth read and written during the sampling period is displayed at the top of the interface.
       （以下有用）
       Use  the  left  and  right  arrows to change the sorting, r to reverse the sorting order, o to toggle the --only option, p to toggle the
       --processes option, a to toggle the --accumulated option, q to quit or i to change the priority of a thread or a process’ thread(s). Any
       other key will force a refresh.
       
       --version
              Show the version number and exit

       -h, --help
              Show usage information and exit

       -o, --only
              Only  show  processes or threads actually doing I/O, instead of showing all processes or threads. This can be dynamically toggled
              by pressing o.

       -b, --batch
              Turn on non-interactive mode.  Useful for logging I/O usage over time.

       -n NUM, --iter=NUM （有用）
              Set the number of iterations before quitting (never quit by default).  This is most useful in non-interactive mode.

       -d SEC, --delay=SEC
              Set the delay between iterations in seconds (1 second by default).  Accepts non-integer values such as 1.1 seconds.

       -p PID, --pid=PID
              A list of processes/threads to monitor (all by default).

       -u USER, --user=USER
              A list of users to monitor (all by default)

       -P, --processes （有用）
              Only show processes. Normally iotop shows all threads.

       -a, --accumulated  （有用）
              Show accumulated I/O instead of bandwidth. In this mode, iotop shows the amount of I/O processes have done since iotop started.

       -k, --kilobytes      （有用）
              Use kilobytes instead of a human friendly unit. This mode is useful when scripting the batch mode of iotop. Instead  of  choosing
              the most appropriate unit iotop will display all sizes in kilobytes.

       -t, --time
              Add a timestamp on each line (implies --batch). Each line will be prefixed by the current time.

       -q, --quiet
              suppress some lines of header (implies --batch). This option can be specified up to three times to remove header lines.
              -q     column names are only printed on the first iteration,
              -qq    column names are never printed,
              -qqq   the I/O summary is never printed.
```

例如，想找到哪个进程在写磁盘比较猛
```shell
sudo /usr/sbin/iotop -a -k -P
```
