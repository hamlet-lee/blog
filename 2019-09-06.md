# Hive 和 Presto 实现 pivot 和 unpivot 的方法
参考：https://support.treasuredata.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001451248-Hive-Presto-Standard-SQL-Tips

1. 标准SQL
Pivot
```sql
SELECT uid,
   max(CASE WHEN key = 'c1' THEN value END) AS c1,
   max(CASE WHEN key = 'c2' THEN value END) AS c2,
   max(CASE WHEN key = 'c3' THEN value END) AS c3
FROM vtable
GROUP BY uid
```

Unpivot
```sql
SELECT uid, 'c1' AS key, c1 AS value FROM htable
UNION ALL
SELECT uid, 'c2' AS key, c2 AS value FROM htable
UNION ALL
SELECT uid, 'c3' AS key, c3 AS value FROM htable
```

1. Presto
Pivot
```sql
SELECT
  uid,
  kv['c1'] AS c1,
  kv['c2'] AS c2,
  kv['c3'] AS c3
FROM (
  SELECT uid, map_agg(key, value) kv
  FROM vtable
  GROUP BY uid
) t
```

Unpivot
```sql
SELECT t1.uid, t2.key, t2.value
FROM htable t1
CROSS JOIN unnest (
  array['c1', 'c2', 'c3'],
  array[c1, c2, c3]
) t2 (key, value)
```

2. Hive
Pivot (to_map是Hive on Arm Treasure Data的UDAF，标准Hive不提供)
```sql
SELECT
  uid,
  kv['c1'] AS c1,
  kv['c2'] AS c2,
  kv['c3'] AS c3
FROM (
  SELECT uid, to_map(key, value) kv
  FROM vtable
  GROUP BY uid
) t
```

Unpivot
```sql
SELECT t1.uid, t2.key, t2.value
FROM htable t1
LATERAL VIEW explode (map(
  'c1', c1,
  'c2', c2,
  'c3', c3
)) t2 as key, value
```
