# Hadoop YARN - Capacity Scheduler 的 user-limit-factor 属性
该属性可以控制单个用户能够多用些资源。

  参考： https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r2.7.1/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/CapacityScheduler.html
  ```
  yarn.scheduler.capacity.<queue-path>.user-limit-factor
  ```
  
The multiple of the queue capacity which can be configured to allow a single user to acquire more resources. By default this is set to 1 which ensures that a single user can never take more than the queue’s configured capacity irrespective of how idle th cluster is. Value is specified as a float. 

如果需要投机用到更多资源，相关参数也需要配置：

队列最大能占用的比例（当总体有空闲时）
```
yarn.scheduler.capacity.<queue-path>.maximum-capacity
```

Maximum queue capacity in percentage (%) as a float. This limits the elasticity for applications in the queue. Defaults to -1 which disables it.

最大的pending and running 的 application 数量
```
yarn.scheduler.capacity.maximum-applications / yarn.scheduler.capacity.<queue-path>.maximum-applications
```
Maximum number of applications in the system which can be concurrently active both running and pending. Limits on each queue are directly proportional to their queue capacities and user limits. This is a hard limit and any applications submitted when this limit is reached will be rejected. Default is 10000. This can be set for all queues with yarn.scheduler.capacity.maximum-applications and can also be overridden on a per queue basis by setting yarn.scheduler.capacity.<queue-path>.maximum-applications. Integer value expected. 

基础资源
```
yarn.scheduler.capacity.<queue-path>.capacity
```
Queue capacity in percentage (%) as a float (e.g. 12.5). The sum of capacities for all queues, at each level, must be equal to 100. Applications in the queue may consume more resources than the queue’s capacity if there are free resources, providing elasticity.
