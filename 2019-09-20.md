> The newer async/await syntax was initially proposed around 2015 for ES2017, to be able to write asynchronous code in a way that reads like synchronous code (without having to use .then() and callback functions).

> ES2015 also introduced Generator functions and the keyword yield. Generators can be used for both synchronous and asynchronous purposes, but it’s important to understand that they are the foundation on which the more popular async/await syntax is built on.

## Generators
> An interesting aspect of generators is that they provide multiple values on demand, one at a time: they only continue their execution up to the next yield or return when someone else requests it. This is a concept similar to the observable/observer design pattern, except that generator functions act as *a passive producer* of values, instead of an active one. 

> The piece of the code that requests values from the generator function is the *active consumer*, because it takes the initiative to request values, it isn’t just listening to receive passively.

> when you call a generator function it doesn’t actually run the code of the function, it will immediately (synchronously) return a special type of object called a Generator object. This object functions as an iterator, among other things, so for simplicity’s sake we’ll refer to it here as “iterator”. 

> <b>In general, iterator.next() executes the generator function up until its next stopping point, whether that’s an intermediate yield statement or the final return. </b>

> <b>Calling next() always produces an object with a value property and a done property, which is a boolean.</b> 

## await / async
> Keep in mind that async/await makes it easier to implement a particular use case of generators. Generator functions/yield and Async functions/await can both be used to write asynchronous code that “waits”, which means code that looks as if it was synchronous, even though it really is asynchronous; it doesn’t use callbacks.

> With generator functions, we can use yield to wait for the async function “getUsersFromDatabase” to resolve, and then just set the returned value as our users:

```javascript
function init() {
    getUsersFromDB().then(
        result => {
            const users = result;
            // Do sth with users
        }
    )
    // Other similar op
}
```

变成辅助理解的形式

```javascript
function* init () {
  const users = yield getUsersFromDB();
  // Do sth with users
  // Other similar op
}
```

> This definitely looks easier to read, but it doesn’t work quite so simply. As the term implies, the keyword “yield” really yields the control of execution to whoever called the generator function. This means there must be an external function that is in charge of receiving the yielded promise, waiting until it resolves, and then pushing the result back into the generator function so that it can resume execution and assign that value to the users variable.

这看起来简单些，但实际上yield时会失去执行权，外部还需要一个循环来等Promise的Resolve，并且再把返回值push回这个Generator Function里 --- push回去可能只是YY出来的操作？？？

> This introduces an aspect of generator functions that we hadn’t seen before: At any of the “stopping points” in a generator function, not only can they yield values to an external function, but they also can receive values from outside. This allows for a back-and-forth communication between two pieces of code.

Generator 不仅是往外抛出数据，还会接受数据！这样就能在两段代码之间来回通信 --- 真的吗？

> Passing values into a generator function is achieved by passing them as arguments into the iterator’s “next” method.

可以通过.next(arg)来传递参数！

> This is a simple scenario because the code is implemented specifically for a generator function that yields only one value.

这是只yield一次的特例。实际的外围函数是能处理无限个的情况的！

async + await 就有这样的效果：
```javascript
async function test() {
    const users = await getUsersFromDB();
    return (user + " Correctly received")  // 后面的说明来看，这里实际上应该return一个Promise
}
```

> The asterisk notation of generators is replaced by placing the keyword async in front of the function declaration, and “yield” is replaced by “await”. Await can be placed in front of any statement that returns a promise, and the await keyword can only be used inside functions that are marked by the async keyword before their declaration.

async函数的限制
1) <b>Async functions always return a promise</b>: Since async functions pause their execution at any “await” keyword to wait for asynchronous expressions to resolve, they themselves become asynchronous (and hence why they have the async keyword in front of them). That means that regardless of what you return from that function, functions with the async keyword will always return a promise, that will resolve to whatever you returned, or throw an error. <b>In the previous example, the function “test” returns the string “Test Users Correctly received”, but in reality it will actually return a promise that will resolve to that string.</b> This is important to keep in mind when designing your code and thinking about how other parts of the code are going to interact with any given function, whether they are expecting to receive a promise or not.

2) <b>Await can only wait for promises sequentially, not in parallel.</b> The await keyword can only wait for promises one at a time, not several at once. Therefore, if you have to deal with several promises and you want to wait for them with await, you’ll have to wait for each one to complete before moving on to the next.

如果要等多个Promise，可以这样
```javascript
async function init() {
    const profileImages = [];
    const arrayOfPromises = users.map(user => getProfileImage(user));
    profileImages = await Promise.all(arrayOfPromises);
}
```

> Generator functions: If you yield/return a value X, it will always return an iteration object with the form {value: X, done: Boolean}
> Async functions: If you return a value X, it will always return a promise that will either resolve to the value X or throw an error.
