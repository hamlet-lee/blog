Well I am answering myself after a long time; in my specific case, the solution was to put eclipse JVM in listening mode:

Connection Type: "Standard (Socket Listen)"
and reverse the direction of the tunnel:

ssh -L 8001:localhost:8001 user@work   (run on server (S), "localhost" is W)
ssh -R 8001:localhost:8001 user@work   (run at home (H), "localhost" is W)
Some explanation: as in the question, my situation was:

  H  -------------------> S     not working  ( ssh -L 8001:S:8001 user@S  from H)
  H           W  -------> S     working      ( ssh -L 8001:S:8001 user@S  from W)
 home        work      server
While reversing like this:

  H  <------- W           S     ssh -R 8001:localhost:8001 user@W  (from H)
  H           W  <------- S     ssh -L 8001:localhost:8001 user@W  (from S)
 home        work      server
did the trick. In other words, whatever is written on S:8001, is forwarded to W:8001, and whatever in turn is written to W:8001, is forwarded to H:8001, where my eclipse JVM is listening.

The tomcat JVM on S should be started with server=n, with arguments:

-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=n,suspend=n,address=8001
```
